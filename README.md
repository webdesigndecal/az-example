# az-example

AZLyrics redesign sample for Web Design DeCal's lecture on CSS extras.

`original.html` is the page we start with, and we'll take advantage of some of the fancier CSS features below to go from the original page to `index.html`.

- Box shadows
- Accent border colors
- Border radius
- (Linear) gradients
- CSS variables
- Web fonts
- CSS filters
