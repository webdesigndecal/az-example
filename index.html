                <p>
                    I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,<br>
                    But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I<br>
                    Left my scarf there at your sister's house,<br>
                    And you still got it in your drawer even now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.<br>
                    We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.<br>
                    The Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,<br>
                    And I can picture it after all these days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I know it's long gone,<br>
                    And that magic's not here no more,<br>
                    And I might be okay,<br>
                    But I'm not fine at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Cause there we are again on that little town street.<br>
                    You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.<br>
                    Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.<br>
                    You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed<br>
                    And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team<br>
                    You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I know it's long gone<br>
                    And there was nothing else I could do<br>
                    And I forget about you long enough<br>
                    To forget why I needed to
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.<br>
                    We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
                    Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,<br>
                    And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.<br>
                    Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.<br>
                    So casually cruel in the name of being honest.<br>
                    I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br>
                    'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
                    I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it<br>
                    After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
                    Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
                    'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
                    You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so<br>
                    Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
                    It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all<br>
                    Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all<br>
                    It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
                </p>
